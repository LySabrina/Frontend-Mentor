Clipboard design.

Whenever a user scrolls to a header, it will do an animation to expand!

This is done through JS with the scroll event. Based on if the header element is within the viewport, it will have the animation class.
If its outside the viewport, it will remove that animation class.

I also tried to make my CSS code neat by having common classes shared among elements. Then add specific classes that makes the different.
