# Recap Knowledges

Some recap knowledge while I was working on this project.

Did this project to get back into practicing CSS.
Main topics I wanted to focus on:

- BEM
- em vs rem
- padding, margins
- semantic HTML

# em vs rem

Both em and rem are scalable units.
Both convert their values into px.
Both find their values based on a font-size.

em will gain its value based on its parent's font-size.
rem will gain its value based on the <html> font-size

# Finding if element is within a viewport
